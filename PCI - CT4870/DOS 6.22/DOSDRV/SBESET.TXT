1.  OBJECTIVE
    =========

    Use SBESET.EXE to manually configure SB resources or 
    disable SB Emulation. By default, SB Emulation in DOS follows 
    the Windows settings. For example, if you disable SB Emulation 
    in Windows, in the next boot to DOS SB Emulation in DOS 
    disabled. Under rare circumstances you may need to manually 
    reconfigure DOS SB Emulation, for example, if there is conflict 
    in DOS before it can boot to Windows. 


2.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND USAGE
    =================================
    SBESET.EXE is run from the command line. To set SBESET 
    values in the command line, at the DOS prompt, type the 
    SBESET command in a single line. 
    Its syntax is:
  
    SBESET [-Axxx] [-Ix] [-Dx] [-Hx] [-Pxxx] [-Jxxx] [-dx] [-wx] [-c] [-?]
  
    where square brackets [ ] denote optional parameters, and:

  This	
  Parameter   Specifies
  ---------   --------------------------------------------
  -Axxx       SB interface's base I/O address.
              Possible values: 220, 240, 260, 280.
  -Ix         IRQ line used by the audio interface.
              Possible values: 5, 7, 9, 10.
  -Dx         First DMA channel used by the audio interface.
              Possible values: 0, 1, 3 
  -Hx         Second DMA channel used by the audio interface.
              Possible values: 5, 6, 7
  -Pxxx       MPU-401 UART interface’s base I/O address.
              Possible values: 300, 310, 320, 330.
  -Jxxx       Gameport/Joystick interface's base I/O address.
              Possible values: 200, 208, 210, 218, ..., 800, ... 
  -jx         Gameport/Joystick mode. For x, 1 is On, 0 is Off.
  -dx         SB Emulation mode. For x, 1 is Off, 0 is On.
  -wx         Set x to 1 to use the Windows-assigned resource 
              configuration.
              Set x to 0 to use (your) user-assigned resource 
              configuration.
  -c          Display of current SBE resource configuration.
  -?          Help option
  
  An example of an SBESET command is 
      SBESET -A240 -I5 -D3 -J218
  which corresponds to "set the SB interface’s base I/O address
  to 240, the IRQ line used by the audio interface to 5, the 
  First DMA channel used by the audio interface to 3, and the 
  Gameport/Joystick interface to 218".

  Other examples:
  - To reuse Windows-assigned resource configuration:
      SBESET -w0
  - To view a brief description of the parameters:
      SBESET -?
  - To display the current SBE configuration:
      SBESET -c

  For the new configuration to take effect, reboot your computer.

  Notes:

  1. If a parameter that has an associated value is specified, make
     sure the value is specified as well. Note: there must be no 
     space between the parameter letter and the numeric value.
     For example, "-A240" is acceptable but not just "-A"

  2. There must be at least a space between the parameters.

  3. If a parameter is not specified, the previously assigned value 
     for that parameter is used. For example, in
        SBESET -A240 -I5 -D3 -J218
     if the previously assigned value (by Windows or otherwise) for 
     MPU-401 UART interface’s base I/O address is 330, it will 
     continue to be so.

3.  RELATED PROGRAM NOTES
    =========================
    Note that SBESET.exe program will only work with following
    release of SBE DOS drivers or later. If you run SBESET.exe
    with the earlier release of the SBE DOS drivers, there will be
    unexpected results.

4.  FAQ
    ====
    a.  After changing the resource configuration using 
        SBESET.exe,  can I type 
              Exit
        at DOS Mode to go back to Windows and than shut down
        to DOS Mode again for the changed resources to take 
        effect?


    Ans: No, for changes to take effect, a cold reboot is required.

    b.  After changing the resource configurations using 
        SBESET.exe, I realisethat the SB Emulation resources 
        under Device Manager does not reflect changes ?

    Ans: Yes, that is correct.  The resource configurations for 
         DOS Mode is independent of the resource configuration 
         mentioned in SB Emulation page under Windows Device 
         Manager.  SBESET.exe will maintain its own set
         of resource configurations separate from that of Windows.

    c.  Where did SBESET.exe get its other resource 
        configurations (for example, Interrupt, First DMA) when I 
        changed only the Sound Blaster interface base address?

    Ans: When SBESET.exe is run for the first time, it will duplicate 
         a set of the Windows resources currently assigned for 
         SB Emulation as it default values.  Any further changes 
         using SBESET.exe will be based on the initial set of 
         resources.

    d.  How do I use back my windows assigned resource 
        configurations in DOS Mode?

    Ans: With SBESET.exe, there is a switch option "-w". 
         When you run SBESET.exe with the command option 
         "-w1", SB Emulation in DOS Mode is reconfigured to use 
         back Windows assigned resources on the next reboot.
